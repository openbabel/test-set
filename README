Open Babel Test Suite: 2003-02-23
---------------------------------

This directory is for the purposes of test molecules, scripts and results.

The molecules may or may not have different copyrights than the entire
Open Babel distribution. As such, we will distribute them
separately. Additionally, end users may not wish to download a
potentially large test suite. To use, either uncompress and create a
link in your openbabel/test/ directory to this as "test-set"

For example:

> tar xvzf openbabel-tests-20030223.tar.gz	# uncompress the test files
...
> cd openbabel-1.100.2/test			# go to your openbabel source
> ln -s ../../openbabel-tests-20030223 test-set	# create the link
> make check					# run the tests

The organization of this directory may change over time and there will
eventually be additional documentation on the origins of all test files
and documentation on running the various regression tests.

* original/     The test molecules themselves.
* files/	Directory for result files created by running the
		tests (subdirectories for: file-format/files)
* others/       Files not currently part of the "canonical" test set.
* results-DATE.txt	Result files organized by the date run.
		These include the version/usage info from babel, info
		on the machine running the tests and then the output
		and errors from running the tests. In particular, look
		for crashes and errors from the roundtrip test program.

The following directories are depreciated and may be found in the CVS
repository, but not necessarily in distributed test sets.
* testMols/     Previous directory structure.
