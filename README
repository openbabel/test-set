This directory is for the purposes of test molecules, scripts and results.

The molecules may or may not have different copyrights than the entire
Open Babel distribution. As such, we will distribute them separately.

Additionally, end users may not wish to download a potentially large test suite.

The organization of this directory may change over time and there will
eventually be additional documentation on the origins of all test files
and documentation on running the various regression tests.

* original/     The test molecules themselves.
* results/      HTML results and summaries (os/file-format/files)
  * linux/      Subdirectory for most recent linux result files
  * windows/    Ditto.
  * macosx/     Ditto.
* others/       Files not currently part of the "canonical" test set.

* testMols/     Previous directory structure.
