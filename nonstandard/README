Molecule README:
-------------------

This directory (nonstandard) includes files which do not meet
published specifications but may or may not be acceptable. Examples,
include non-standard PDB files (i.e., do not meet published PDB
format, but are de-facto accepted by other programs).

Some files are distributed under different copyrights. This file gives
information on the copyright and distribution terms of all molecules
in this directory, as well as information on the file format type,
the program used to generate the file, and as much "heredity" as possible.
