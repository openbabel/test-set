Molecule README:
-------------------

This directory (invalid) contains files that are completely invalid
and should be rejected. Some are generic (e.g., random data or empty
files, designed to catch programming errors) and some are specific to
a given file format. In all cases, these files should not produce
actual molecular data and should never cause program crashes.

* random	Random binary data
