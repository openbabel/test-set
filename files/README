This directory is for the purposes of test molecules.

 It contains a set of subdirectories for particular file formats.

 Each subdirectory contains the original test files as well as the resulting
  translated files and "roundtrip" files with names like foo.xyz.mol.xyz
  which would represent a roundtrip of a file "foo" from XYZ format -> MOL
  format -> XYZ format.

 Each file is (if possible) run through a "roundtrip" checking program. This
  attempts to find mistakes, i.e. in the number of atoms, the elements of 
  each atom, or the coordinates. (The last is checked to .1A, which is 
  unfortunately the least common denomination in current formats.) It does not
  presently check bonding, even on formats that support it.
