Some files are distributed under different copyrights. This file gives
information on the copyright and distribution terms of all molecules
in this directory, as well as information on the file format type,
the program used to generate the file, and as much "heredity" as possible.

* Data files within the archive may be redistributed in original form
  without restriction. Any redistribution of all or a subset of entries
  that have been modified yet retain their original PDB identifier(s)
  (e.g. 4HHB) is prohibited.
